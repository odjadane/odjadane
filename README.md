Hi there!

I am pursuing a master's degree in electrical engineering at UPJV (France).

I am mostly interested in control theory and its applications in vehicles and mobile robotics but also in embedded systems programming.

The projects published here are mainly done in my free time to consolidate my knowledge and perfect my programming skills.

Here is a list of some other projects I worked on:
- [Line follower robot with PID control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXxMXaPvj-s)
- [Conveyor belt color sorting machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY71AqqvUx8)
- [HMI design in SIMATIC WinCC](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtuQRTdi_pGm9uHDibdcFC5jAG7ptoQEf)
- [A set of small webapps for engineering](https://odjadane.github.io/webapps/)
